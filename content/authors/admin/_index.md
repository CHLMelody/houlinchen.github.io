Greetings! I am currently a third-year undergraduate student pursuing an Honours B.S. degree in the [Faculty of Arts and Science](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), Toronto, ON, CA. Throughout my university research, I engaged in multiple projects encompassing various aspects, such as Bayesian estimation for distributional differences, multiple linear regression for multivariate data analysis, and Monte Carlo approximations. Concurrently, I am undertaking an internship in marketing data analysis at [AP Lazer Canada Mfg. Inc.](https://aplazer.com/), Windsor, ON, CA. My research interests include Bayesian Statistics, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.
