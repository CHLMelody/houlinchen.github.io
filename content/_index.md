        Greetings! I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing an Honours B.S. degree in the [Faculty of Arts and Science](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), Toronto, ON, CA. As a visiting student, I spent my Summer 2021 at both [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). Throughout my undergraduate research, I have engaged in multiple projects encompassing various aspects, such as Bayesian estimation for distributional differences, multiple linear regression for multivariate data analysis, and Monte Carlo approximations. Concurrently, I am undertaking an internship in marketing data analysis at [AP Lazer](https://aplazer.com/), Windsor, ON, CA. My research interests include Bayesian Statistics, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.
